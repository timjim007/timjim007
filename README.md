## 🛠️ Projects I'm Proud Of

- **🌡️ RTOS-Based Environmental Monitor**  
  Built a mini operating system on an STM32 using **FreeRTOS** that reads from a **DHT11 temperature sensor** and toggles display modes (clock vs. temperature) on an LCD.

- **🔋 Capstone: Battery Display over CAN Bus**  
  Developed a handheld plug-and-play device using **RP2040** to monitor and display real-time EV battery data via the **CAN bus**.

- **🧠 8-bit CPU in Verilog on FPGA**  
  Designed a custom 8-bit CPU from scratch and implemented it on the **Basys 3** FPGA, with working RAM, ROM, register file, and instruction decode logic — a full educational CPU architecture.
